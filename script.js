/* Multiplication */

// Create 2 variables, a & b, and set to ne random integers between 3 and 9
var a = Math.floor(math.random()*10-3)+3;
var b = Math.floor(math.random()*10-3)+3;
// Set a variable called product to be the product of a and b
var product = a*b;
// Set a variable called equation to display  a * b = ??
var equation = alert(a + "*" + b + "=??");
// Ask the equation of the user and store the user input in a variable called answer
answer = prompt(equation);
// Say "Correct!" if the answer and product match, "Incorrect!" if not.
if (answer == product) alert ("Correct!");
else alert ("Incorrect!");
/* Multiplication whjile Loop */

// Embed all this code in a While loop and run it 5 times.

/* Multiplication For Loop */
// Convert the while loop to a for loop.
